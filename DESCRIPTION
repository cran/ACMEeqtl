        Linear Model

Description: We use a non-linear model, termed ACME, 
    that reflects a parsimonious biological model for 
    allelic contributions of cis-acting eQTLs.
    With non-linear least-squares algorithm we 
    estimate maximum likelihood parameters. The ACME model
    provides interpretable effect size estimates and
    p-values with well controlled Type-I error.
    Includes both R and (much faster) C implementations.
